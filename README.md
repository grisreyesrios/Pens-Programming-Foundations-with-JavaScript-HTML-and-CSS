## Web Projects under Construction--HTML/CSS/JavaScript

This repository contains all material related to web projects that are currently under development. It is shown pictures of the most significant and the link to the online editor *Codepen*. 

### Projects and Description

#### [*Periodic Table: Family IA or Alkali Metals, full page*](https://codepen.io/grisreyesrios/full/vaVZOg/)

My background is in Chemistry and Materials Science. The first steps as Chemist are always related to elements and their characteristics and properties. My goal with this project is to display significant information regarding the different families of the periodic table with interactivity. Once I completed this, I will build a website. 
The principal web elements that are used at the moment are *tabs* and *embed videos*
